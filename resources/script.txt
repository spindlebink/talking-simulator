1: Hello!
2: Hello.
1: How's it going?
2: Going? / Hm. / I guess / it's going good.
1: Why the hesitation?
2: Hesitation?
1: You hesitated.
2: I didn't mean to / hesitate—
1: You did.
2: Hm. / I guess I'm just / a little / [rainbow][shake]depressed[/shake][/rainbow].
1: [rainbow][wave]Depressed?[/wave][/rainbow]
2: [rainbow][shake]Depressed.[/shake][/rainbow]
1: Depressed how?
2: To be honest / I don't know.
1: You mean with work?
2: Maybe.
1: What do you mean, / 'maybe'?
2: How many meanings / of 'maybe' / are there?
1: You know what I mean.
2: Hm. / I guess. / I guess I'm just / [rainbow][shake]depressed[/shake][/rainbow] / for no reason.
2: My family's fine / the weather's nice / [rainbow]Spring has sprung[/rainbow] / I have few / outstanding [b]debts[/b] / & mercury isn't / in [tornado]retrograde[/tornado] / or anything. / [wave][i]shrugs[/i][/wave]
1: Hey, I get that— / sometimes it just / is how it is.
2: Life's not / [shake]excruciatingly painful[/shake] / or even / [shake]unpleasant[/shake] / it just keeps [i]going[/i]. / And I'm doing these things / that seem increasingly / [shake]arbitrary[/shake]. / And I'm beginning / to wonder / whether I do them / because I want to / and I'm interested / or because / I just feel / compelled.
1: Hm.
2: I don't know, man / I don't know. / There's just / this jagged / sort of rhythm / to everything: / each day's different / and there's stuff / to do / and things / to learn / and [tornado]fun and pleasure[/tornado] / to be had / but underneath / it's still just / far-away / somehow. / And it goes on / and on— / unfrustrating / unending / unrelenting.
1: Well, shit, dude / I guess— / sometimes / when I feel / [rainbow][shake]depressed[/shake][/rainbow] / I try to focus / on the things / that make me / [rainbow][shake]smile[/shake][/rainbow]. / I don't mean / to be one of those / people who just say / 'Stop being / [rainbow][shake]depressed[/shake][/rainbow]' / but sometimes, / you know, / that's all there is / to do.
2: I get you. / [shake][i]sighs[/i][/shake] / Just makes me wonder / is there really / anything past this— / anything beyond / doing this same / thing into nausea— / does it go / anywhere— / is there / a [shake]payoff[/shake]?
1: A [shake]payoff?[/shake] / You mean like / [tornado]heaven[/tornado]?
2: [tornado]Heaven[/tornado]? / Maybe. / I don't know. / I'd take / really any payoff / at all.
1: I get you. / [i][wave]sighs[/wave][/i] / ... / [i][wave](sympathetically)[/wave][/i] / I don't have / an answer for you. / I guess / we just have to / wait and see.
2: [i]Wait and see.[/i] / Yeah. / I guess so.
1: I don't know, man / I don't know.
